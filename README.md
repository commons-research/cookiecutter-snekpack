# Python Cookiecutter

A [cookiecutter](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter) for making new Python repositories.

This template is different from [@audreyr](https://github.com/audreyr)'s
[cookiecutter-pypackage](https://github.com/audreyfeldroy/cookiecutter-pypackage) because it uses the source
layout and has lots of code quality assurance checks built in. If you're looking for something similar but not quite
like this, try her package or see her [list of alternatives](https://cookiecutter-pypackage.readthedocs.io/en/latest/readme.html#similar-cookiecutter-templates).

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

1. Install `cookiecutter` with:

    ```shell
    $ pip install cookiecutter
    ```

2. Run `cookiecutter` with:

    ```shell
    $ cookiecutter https://github.com/cthoyt/cookiecutter-python-package
    ```

3. Enter the requested information, then win! Remember, package names should only have letters, numbers,
   and underscores.

4. If you're working under version control, copy the repository into your folder tracked under git, commit
   the files, and push to your remote.
